        Hi, thank you for joining the beta! This site is in the early stages
        of being live, so I appreciate your help in figuring out where the
        issues are. If you see something wrong, or the site is missing a key
        feature you think it should have, please drop me a message at
        campfinder@campfinder.me. You can also <a href="https://github.com/e-staats/CampFinder/issues">open an
            issue</a> on Github if you'd like. Happy camping! â›º
